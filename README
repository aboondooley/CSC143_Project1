Comments: I enjoyed this project, I think it was helpful in understanding how to implement interfaces and extend abstract classes.
I also really enjoyed the WorldRunner.java part, I thought it gave me a deeper understanding of how the classes were constructed
and interacted with each other. I probably spend an extra 2 hours on the world runner part.
